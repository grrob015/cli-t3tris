# cli-t3tris
It's called 't3tris' because all the pieces are made with three squares.

<h2> Purpose of the project </h2>
This project was meant to practice using matrixes and loops in the C programming language, and to become generally more familiar and comfortable with the language. If I was to change and improve this project now, I would add a persistent high score system that used a text file that the program could read and write to.

<h2> Video demonstration of compiling and running </h2>
