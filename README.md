# cli-t3tris
It's called 't3tris' because all the pieces are made with three squares.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- KDE Plasma (Desktop environment for Linux, X11 and Wayland compatible)
- GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection
- Konsole (Graphical Terminal Command Shell)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Arch Linux (Kernel Version 6.12.1)

<h2> Purpose of the project </h2>
This project was meant to practice using matrixes and loops in the C programming language, and to become generally more familiar and comfortable with the language. If I was to change and improve this project now, I would add a persistent high score system that used a text file that the program could read and write to.
